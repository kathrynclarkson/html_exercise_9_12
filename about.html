		<title>Why I am Interested In Coding</head>
		<h2>Also Know As Why I'm Here<h2>
		<p>Growing up computers were prohibted until I was about 12, after that they were strictly monitered. In the conservative world that I grew up in computers were a source of evil, not a source of knowledge. Eventually I became involved in competitive debate and had to use a computer to do research, ect. This marked my foray into the world of using a computer. </p>
<p> I was never exposed to the world of coding as a child but as I began to slowely be exposed to the interworkings of websites, computers and apps I became fascinated. Eventually I met the person who is now my husband and he made me watch multiple tutorials on things that I did not understand. Slowely I began to absorb some of the information and become more and more interested in the world of coding. </p>
<p> About the time that I became seriosuly interested in coding my boss asked me to make him a website using WordPress and to set up Zoho. These adventures into the "techy" side of things confirmed that I really did want to study coding. After I made that realization, I applied for CodeCraft and now here I am." "
