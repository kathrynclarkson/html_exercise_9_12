		<h2>A Very Brief Summary of My Life</h2>

		<P>I was homeschooled from preschool-12th grade. As a resentful 18 yearold who wanted to escape the conservative, small town life that I had been forced to live, I applied for college in New York City. At 18 I packed my suitcase and moved to New York City. I soon realized that large cities were not my thing so I transferred schools and moved to Austin</P>
